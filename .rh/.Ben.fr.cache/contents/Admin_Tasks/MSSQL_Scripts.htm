  Running a MSSQL Script to update your FES database.
  This section describes how to execute a SQL script to make changes to the schema of your FES database. 
  Email Package V1.0.0.0
  You will recieve via email a 'Zipped' file. Unpack this file.
  There are two files. Each file is a SQL 'Script'. 
   
  001_CreateIDFESSchema_v1.sql
  
    The FES database must exists. 
    This script builds the schema for the database.
    After it's executed the empty FES database will be populated by tables. 
  
   
  002_SystemDataIDFES_v1.sql
  
    The FES tables must exists. 
    This script populates the tables with esential core data.
    After it's executed, some of tables will contain records.
     
  
   
  
    Open Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio.
   
  
    Connect to the SQL EXPRESS server.
   
  Expand the 'Databases' branch in the 'Object Explorer' window (left side of application)
    
  Select the FES database.
   
  NEXT
  Drag the file 001_CreateIDFESSchema_v1.sql onto the MSSMS desktop (big blue area)
   
  
  Press the execute button.
   
  Once MSSMS is done running the script - you should see tables inside FES AND most importantly - no errors!
  
   
  
  Close the tab containing the 001_CreateIDFESSchema_v1.sql script.
   
  NEXT 
  Drag the file 002_SystemDataIDFES_v1.sql onto the MSSMS desktop (big blue area)
   
  Press the execute button.
   
  Once MSSMS is finished ...
   
  Close the tab containing the 001_CreateIDFESSchema_v1.sql script.
   
  NEXT
  Explore the FES tables for records.
   
  
  Here I right moused over the table AddressType and selected 'Select Top 1000 Rows' from the 'pop-up' menu.
     
  
  It produced a script which automatically ran, resulting in a table view of records in that table.
   
  NEXT
