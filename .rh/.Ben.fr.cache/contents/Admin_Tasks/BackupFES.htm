  How to backup your SCM data.
  It important to schedule a regular backup of the data stored in FES. You may very well keep years of historical data and it would be tragic to lose it.
  Backup and restore of the FES database is done with Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
  Run the application.
  Connect to your MSSQL EXPRESS FES database.
  
    
      
    
    
      
        
          Expand Databases in the Object Explorer panel by pressing its + symbol
           
        
      
      
        
          Hover over FES and RIGHT-MOUSE click to show the context sensitive pop-up menu
          Select the menu item Tasks, then select Back Up ...
        
      
      
        
          Your back up settings should read ...
          Database: FES (in this instance, the database has been personalized and was named IDFES or Ipswich District Fire Equipment Services.)
            Backup type: Full
            Back up to: Disk
          If a backup filename isn't listed, select a backup destination. 
          Press OK to begin the backup.
          Note: in this example MSSMS places the backup file in the default backup directory. Typically this is : 
            C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup
          Your backup filename must use the extension .bak (Example: IDFES.bak)
          Good pratice is to have three copies of your backup.
          
            The default location on the DB server. (For easy access.) 
            In a safe place with-in the office or in the 'Cloud'. (In case the server dies.)
            And an external location. (In case your office is burnt-down or the 'Cloud' goes down.)
          
          Depending on the amount of work done, good practise is to backup on a weekly scheduled.
          It's possible to automate backups using a shell script.
